## Installation

To install this project, you need to have Python and Pip installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cd Zimrates
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```



This will install the dependencies and create the database.


##Usage
To start the server, run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will launch the server on http://localhost:8000.
You can use any HTTP client to make requests to the API. 
This API is facing one end meaning you can do `POST` or `PATCH` and this is by design.

The API supports the following endpoint:

- `GET /rates` - Returns a list of all available rates

The API uses JSON as the data format for both requests and responses. For example, a successful response for `GET /rates` might look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "black_market": 85.0,
    "black_market_sell": 90.0,
    "created_on": "2023-09-08T17:45:58Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "black_market": 1800.0,
    "black_market_sell": 1850.0,
    "created_on": "2023-09-08T17:45:58Z"
  }
]
```
