This is a REST API built with Django REST framework that provides access to the latest market rates in Zimbabwe. You can use this API to get the exchange rates of various currencies, commodities and services in Zimbabwe.

##Usage
To start the server, run:

This will launch the server on http://localhost:8000.
You can use any HTTP client to make requests to the API. The API supports the following endpoint:

- `GET /rates` - Returns a list of all available rates

The API uses JSON as the data format for both requests and responses. For example, a successful response for `GET /rates` might look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "black_market": 85.0,
    "black_market_sell": 90.0,
    "created_on": "2023-09-08T17:45:58Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "black_market": 1800.0,
    "black_market_sell": 1850.0,
    "created_on": "2023-09-08T17:45:58Z"
